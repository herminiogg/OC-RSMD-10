# FAIR-IMPACT-RSMD-GUIDELINES - OC-RSMD-10
This repository includes all the resources and documentation generated during the implementation of the [RSMD guidelines](https://zenodo.org/records/10786147) to two of my software project: [ShExML](https://github.com/herminiogg/ShExML) and [DMAOG](https://github.com/herminiogg/dmaog). At the same time it includes a workflow for creating intrinsic metadata in the form of a Codemeta file from different intrinsic and extrinsic metadata providers.

# Structure
For the implementation stories you will find the reports in the [implementation-reports folder](implementation-reports).

For the mapping reusable workflow you can see access the resources in the [codemeta-shexml repository](https://github.com/herminiogg/codemeta-shexml) which has been added as a submodule of this repository for convenience.

# Funding
This work is funded by a cascading grant entitled "2nd open call for Route 2 support - #1 Assessing and improving Research Software" provided by the FAIR-IMPACT project which, in turn, has received funding from the European Commissionâ€™s Horizon Europe funding programme for research and innovation programme under the Grant Agreement no. 101057344.
